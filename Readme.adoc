`Spring Boot` Web Java application that provides swagger dashboard with drop down menu.
From this menu documentation for each microservice can be fetched instantly.

* *person-application*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that provides rest endpoints to add person data and fetch person data.

* *employee-application*
