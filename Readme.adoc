= centralised-api-documentation

The goal of this project is to implement a centralised documentation service using swagger, where API documentation for each microservice is available on single dashboard and user don't have to navigate to different urls.

== Technologies used

* `Swagger` to generate API documentation.
* `Spring Boot` for creating API
* `Gradle` build tool.
* `Eureka` as service registration and discovery

== Applications

* *documentation-app*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that provides swagger dashboard with drop down menu.
From this menu documentation for each microservice can be fetched instantly.

* *employee-application*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that provides rest endpoints to add person data and fetch person data.

* *employee-application*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that provides rest endpoints to add employee data and fetch employee data.

== Configuration and shared components

* *eureka-swagger-client-config*
+
`Spring Boot` module that provides common configurations for CORS and EUREKA for each microservice.

== Running Applications with Gradle

Inside `centralised-api-documentation` root folder, run the following `Gradle` commands in different terminals

* *documentation-app*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :documentation-app:bootRun
----

* *employee-application*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :employee-application:bootRun
----

* *person-application*
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :person-application:bootRun
----

== Spring Rest Docs

This is another flavor of api documentation.
This generates documentation for RESTful services that is both accurate and readable.
It providing guarantees that the documentation is up to date (TDD)

The Spring Rest Docs project uses ASCIIDoctor, Junit Test and is compatible with both Maven and Gradle.

Spring Rest Docs are implemented in `person-application`.

For implementation `asciidoctor` plugin needed to be added in `build.gradle`.
Also `spring-restdocs-mockmvc` along with `junit` and `spring-boot-starter-test` dependencies needed to be added to `build.gradle`.

Junit test cases needs to be written and a asciidoctor template need to be added which will be used to generate Spring Rest Docs.



== Generating Documentation with Gradle

* *person-application*
+
First run junit test cases.
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :person-application:test
----
Now run `asciidoctor` task.
+
[source]
----
./gradlew :person-application:asciidoctor
----

This command will generate spring rest documentation html file form `.adoc` template in `person-application/docs/html5` directory.
